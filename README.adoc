=  The Bootiful Podcast Site Itself

image::https://github.com/bootiful-podcast/site-v1/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg[Status]


== Description 

This site runs at http://bootifulpodcast.fm[bootifulpodcast.fm] or http://development.bootifulpodcast.fm[development.bootifulpodcast.fm]

The goal for this codebase is to obviate the need for the static site-generator module by having a dynamic site based on HTTP REST calls and Vue.js


== Technical Notes 

This site talks to the backend API, and it uses Vue.js for the development of the frontend website.
